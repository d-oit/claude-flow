# Issue Report

**Title**: Critical Memory Leaks in Memory Management Components

## Description
Multiple critical memory leaks have been identified in the core memory management components of the Claude-Flow system. These leaks can cause unbounded memory growth, eventual system crashes, and significant performance degradation over time. The issues span across the main memory manager, advanced memory manager, cache implementation, and swarm memory components.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the Claude-Flow system for an extended period (24+ hours)
2. Perform frequent memory operations (store, retrieve, query)
3. Create and close multiple memory banks
4. Observe gradual memory increase in process monitoring tools
5. Eventually encounter out-of-memory errors or system slowdowns

## Expected Behavior
- Memory usage should remain relatively stable over time
- Memory banks should be properly cleaned up when closed
- Cache should evict entries when approaching size limits
- Automatic cleanup should prevent unbounded growth
- System should maintain consistent performance regardless of runtime duration

## Actual Behavior
- Memory usage grows continuously without bound
- Closed memory banks leave residual data in memory
- Cache becomes bloated with dirty entries that cannot be evicted
- Expired entries accumulate due to async deletion delays
- Agent memory associations grow indefinitely without cleanup
- Automatic cleanup intervals may not run frequently enough

## Environment Details
- **Version**: Claude-Flow development version
- **OS**: Linux 6.8
- **Browser**: N/A (Node.js application)
- **Additional Components**: Memory management system, cache, swarm memory

## Additional Context
Memory leaks identified across multiple components:

### 1. Memory Bank Leak (manager.ts:52)
```typescript
private banks = new Map<string, MemoryBank>();
```
- Memory banks are added but only removed when explicitly closed
- Unclosed banks accumulate indefinitely
- No automatic cleanup of orphaned banks

### 2. Cache Bloat (cache.ts:224-226)
```typescript
if (entry.dirty && evicted.length > 0) {
  continue; // Don't evict dirty entries if possible
}
```
- Dirty entries are never evicted from cache
- Cache can grow beyond size limits due to dirty entries
- No mechanism to clean up old dirty entries

### 3. Unbounded Entry Growth (advanced-memory-manager.ts:189)
```typescript
private entries = new Map<string, MemoryEntry>();
```
- Entries are added but cleanup is not guaranteed
- Multiple cleanup phases but edge cases can still cause growth
- No upper bound on total entries without manual cleanup

### 4. Agent Memory Accumulation (swarm-memory.ts:89)
```typescript
private agentMemories = new Map<string, Set<string>>();
```
- Agent memory associations grow indefinitely
- No cleanup when agents are removed or become inactive
- Memory limits only apply to entries, not associations

### 5. Async Deletion Backlog (manager.ts:534)
```typescript
setTimeout(() => this.deleteEntry(entry.id), 0);
```
- Expired entries are scheduled for deletion but not immediately processed
- Backlog of deletions can accumulate over time
- No mechanism to limit the size of deletion queue

### 6. Interval Timer Leaks (manager.ts:422-430)
```typescript
this.syncInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  // sync logic
}, this.config.syncInterval);
```
- Intervals may not be properly cleaned up in all error scenarios
- Multiple instances could be created if initialization fails

## Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Memory bank leak, cache bloat, unbounded entry growth
- **High**: Agent memory accumulation, async deletion backlog
- **Medium**: Interval timer leaks, cleanup inefficiencies

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Implement Memory Bank Cleanup**
   ```typescript
   // Add periodic cleanup of orphaned banks
   private cleanupOrphanedBanks(): void {
     const now = Date.now();
     const orphaned = Array.from(this.banks.entries())
       .filter(([_, bank]) => now - bank.lastAccessed.getTime() > 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
     
     orphaned.forEach(([id]) => this.banks.delete(id));
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Cache Eviction Policy**
   ```typescript
   // Modify eviction to handle dirty entries
   private evict(requiredSpace: number): void {
     // Force eviction of some dirty entries if needed
     const dirtyEntries = Array.from(this.cache.entries())
       .filter(([_, entry]) => entry.dirty);
     
     if (dirtyEntries.length > 0 && this.currentSize > this.maxSize * 0.9) {
       // Evict oldest dirty entries
       dirtyEntries.sort((a, b) => a[1].lastAccessed - b[1].lastAccessed);
       const toEvict = dirtyEntries.slice(0, Math.ceil(dirtyEntries.length * 0.1));
       
       toEvict.forEach(([id]) => {
         const entry = this.cache.get(id);
         if (entry) this.currentSize -= entry.size;
         this.cache.delete(id);
       });
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Entry Growth Limits**
   ```typescript
   // Add hard limits in advanced memory manager
   private enforceEntryLimits(): void {
     if (this.entries.size > this.config.maxEntries) {
       const sorted = Array.from(this.entries.values())
         .sort((a, b) => a.lastAccessedAt.getTime() - b.lastAccessedAt.getTime());
       
       const toRemove = sorted.slice(0, this.entries.size - this.config.maxEntries);
       toRemove.forEach(entry => this.entries.delete(entry.id));
     }
   }
   ```

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Implement Agent Memory Cleanup**
2. **Fix Async Deletion Backlog**
3. **Improve Interval Timer Management**
4. **Add Memory Usage Monitoring**

### Long-term Optimizations
1. **Implement Memory Pressure Detection**
2. **Add Automatic Recovery Mechanisms**
3. **Improve Cleanup Algorithms**
4. **Add Memory Usage Analytics**

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Critical - Can cause system crashes
- **Frequency**: Always occurs with extended runtime
- **User Impact**: High - System becomes unusable over time
- **Business Impact**: High - Downtime and data loss potential
- **Performance Impact**: Severe - Progressive performance degradation

## Testing Recommendations
1. Memory leak detection tools (Node.js --inspect)
2. Long-running integration tests (24+ hours)
3. Memory usage monitoring during operations
4. Stress testing with high-frequency operations
5. Garbage collection analysis and profiling

## Monitoring Requirements
1. Implement memory usage alerts
2. Track memory bank creation/deletion rates
3. Monitor cache hit/miss ratios and sizes
4. Log cleanup operations and their effectiveness
5. Set up automated restart mechanisms when memory limits are exceeded
