# Issue Report

**Title**: Missing Error Recovery in Memory Manager Backend Storage

## Description
The memory manager's backend storage implementation lacks proper error recovery mechanisms. When storing entries in the backend, errors are caught and logged but not recovered from, leading to potential data loss and inconsistency. The async storage operation is not retried, and failed entries are not properly handled, which can cause memory entries to be lost without notification.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the Claude-Flow system
2. Store memory entries while the backend becomes temporarily unavailable
3. Observe that storage errors are logged but entries are not recovered
4. Check that memory entries are missing from the backend
5. Note that the cache and index may be inconsistent with the backend

## Expected Behavior
- Backend storage errors should be automatically retried
- Failed entries should be preserved and retried later
- The system should maintain consistency between cache, index, and backend
- Users should be notified of persistent storage failures
- The system should gracefully handle temporary backend unavailability

## Actual Behavior
- Backend storage errors are caught and logged but not recovered from
- Failed entries are lost without notification
- No retry mechanism for failed storage operations
- Inconsistency between cache/index and backend
- Silent data loss can occur

## Environment Details
- **Version**: Claude-Flow development version
- **OS**: Linux 6.8
- **Browser**: N/A (Node.js application)
- **Additional Components**: Memory management system, backend storage

## Additional Context
### Current Implementation Issue:

#### Memory Manager Store Method (manager.ts:186-191)
```typescript
// Store in backend (async, don't wait)
this.backend.store(entry).catch((error) => {
  this.logger.error('Failed to store entry in backend', {
    id: entry.id,
    error,
  });
});
```

### Problems with Current Implementation:
1. **No Retry Logic**: Failed operations are not retried
2. **Silent Failure**: Errors are logged but users are not notified
3. **Data Loss**: Failed entries are not preserved for later recovery
4. **Inconsistency**: Cache and index may have entries that backend doesn't
5. **No Fallback**: No alternative storage mechanism or user notification

### Impact on System:
- **Data Integrity**: Memory entries can be lost
- **System Reliability**: Backend failures cause silent data loss
- **User Experience**: Users are unaware of data loss
- **Debugging**: Difficult to track down missing entries
- **Recovery**: No automatic recovery from backend failures

### Affected Components:
- Memory Manager (`manager.ts`)
- Advanced Memory Manager (`advanced-memory-manager.ts`)
- Swarm Memory (`swarm-memory.ts`)
- Any component that relies on backend storage

## Priority Levels
- **Critical**: High - Can cause data loss and system inconsistency
- **Impact**: Affects all memory storage operations
- **Risk**: Data corruption and silent failures

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Action (Critical)
1. **Implement Retry Logic**
   ```typescript
   async store(entry: MemoryEntry): Promise<void> {
     try {
       // Add to cache
       this.cache.set(entry.id, entry);
       
       // Add to index
       this.indexer.addEntry(entry);
       
       // Store in backend with retry logic
       await this.retryOperation(
         () => this.backend.store(entry),
         { maxRetries: 3, delayMs: 1000, backoff: true }
       );
       
       // Update bank stats
       this.updateBankStats(entry.agentId);
       
       // Emit event
       this.eventBus.emit('memory:created', { entry });
     } catch (error) {
       this.logger.error('Failed to store memory entry after retries', error);
       
       // Add to failed storage queue for later recovery
       this.failedStorageQueue.add(entry);
       
       throw new MemoryError('Failed to store memory entry', { error });
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Failed Storage Queue**
   ```typescript
   private failedStorageQueue = new Set<MemoryEntry>();
   private recoveryInterval?: NodeJS.Timeout;
   
   private startRecoveryInterval(): void {
     this.recoveryInterval = setInterval(async () => {
       await this.recoverFailedStorage();
     }, this.config.recoveryIntervalMs || 30000);
   }
   
   private async recoverFailedStorage(): Promise<void> {
     const failedEntries = Array.from(this.failedStorageQueue);
     if (failedEntries.length === 0) return;
     
     this.logger.info(`Attempting to recover ${failedEntries.length} failed storage operations`);
     
     for (const entry of failedEntries) {
       try {
         await this.backend.store(entry);
         this.failedStorageQueue.delete(entry);
         this.logger.info(`Recovered failed storage for entry: ${entry.id}`);
       } catch (error) {
         this.logger.warn(`Failed to recover storage for entry: ${entry.id}`, error);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Add Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   ```typescript
   private circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({
     timeout: 5000,
     errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
     resetTimeout: 30000,
   });
   
   async store(entry: MemoryEntry): Promise<void> {
     try {
       // Add to cache and index
       this.cache.set(entry.id, entry);
       this.indexer.addEntry(entry);
       
       // Use circuit breaker for backend storage
       await this.circuitBreaker.execute(() => this.backend.store(entry));
       
       // Emit event
       this.eventBus.emit('memory:created', { entry });
     } catch (error) {
       if (this.circuitBreaker.state.open) {
         this.logger.warn('Circuit breaker open, using fallback storage');
         await this.fallbackStorage(entry);
       }
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Add Fallback Storage Mechanism**
2. **Implement User Notification for Persistent Failures**
3. **Add Storage Health Monitoring**
4. **Implement Data Consistency Checks**

### Long-term Optimizations
1. **Add Predictive Error Detection**
2. **Implement Automatic Failover to Alternative Backends**
3. **Add Data Recovery Analytics**
4. **Implement Storage Performance Monitoring**

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Critical - Can cause data loss and system inconsistency
- **Frequency**: Common - Occurs when backend is temporarily unavailable
- **User Impact**: High - Data loss can affect user workflows
- **Business Impact**: High - Data loss can lead to user dissatisfaction
- **Performance Impact**: Low - Retry logic adds minimal overhead

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Error Injection Tests**: Simulate backend failures during storage
2. **Retry Logic Tests**: Verify retry behavior and backoff
3. **Recovery Tests**: Test failed storage recovery mechanism
4. **Circuit Breaker Tests**: Test circuit breaker behavior
5. **Consistency Tests**: Verify data consistency after failures
6. **Performance Tests**: Measure impact of retry logic on performance

## Monitoring Requirements
1. **Failed Storage Rate**: Monitor rate of storage failures
2. **Retry Success Rate**: Track retry success vs. failure rates
3. **Recovery Time**: Monitor time to recover from failures
4. **Circuit Breaker State**: Track circuit breaker open/closed states
5. **Data Consistency**: Monitor consistency between cache, index, and backend
6. **Alerts**: Alert on high failure rates or prolonged recovery times
